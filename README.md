# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Flight Ticket Price Prediction project

✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the ticket fare of domestic flights in India based on factors like airline, cities, class, duration, stops, and days left before departure.

📌 Project Overview

Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on several factors. This project analyses a large dataset of Indian flight fares and builds ML models to accurately predict flight prices.
We built an end-to-end system with:

✔ Data preprocessing

✔ Feature engineering

✔ Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost etc.)

✔ Model comparison & evaluation

✔ Flask backend for prediction API

✔ Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) for user input

✔ Deployment-ready Python code

📂 Tech Stack

Frontend-

JavaScript

Backend-

Python

Flask

Flask-CORS

Machine Learning-

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

CatBoost

RandomForest

📊 Dataset Features

Model is trained on the following important features:

source_city, 
destination_city, 
departure_time, 
arrival_time, 
stops, 
class, 
duration, 
days_left

Note: Dataset does not contain weekday/weekend info. Prediction is based only on the above factors.

🧠 Models Used

1️⃣ Linear Regression

Baseline model

Simple & interpretable

Helps understand feature importance

2️⃣ Random Forest Regressor

Works well on non-linear data

Reduces overfitting

Better than Linear Regression


3️⃣ CatBoost Regressor
Handles categorical features automatically

Reduces need for one-hot encoding

Fast training

High accuracy

4️⃣ XGBoost Regressor (Best Model)

Most powerful model in the project

Gradient-boosted decision-tree algorithm

Captures complex patterns very well

Fast & optimized

Highest accuracy among all models

Conclusion-

XGBoost  model gives highest accuracy 

It outperformed Linear Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost.

The major factors affecting flight fare are:

days_left, 
class, 
duration, 
airline
stops

The full pipeline includes data preprocessing, ML model training, Flask backend, and a frontend for user input.
